Hell, if you pay us enough, well show any ad you like, such as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeK5ZjtpO-M">advert</a>.</p>
    <h3>Our commitment to Privacy</h3>
    <p>Here at <strong>Websiteâ„¢</strong>(trademark pending) we care about our user's privacy, we provide relevant ads for you, while keeping you private. Here we log all of your IP addresses, your search history (we saw that) as well as your location history, because we can.</p>
    <h3>About Us (me)</h3>
    <p>This website was made in 08/16/2021 by a 15 year old at Edison High School, and this is literally the second thing I have made in HTML, so I hope you can tolerate this... mess? I am not sure, but if you want let me know, I am happy to learn more. My email is right here and it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">example@example.com</a>.</p>
