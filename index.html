    <p style="color:white">This website was made in 08/16/2021 by a 15 year old at Edison High School, and this is literally the second thing I have made in HTML, so I hope you can tolerate this... mess? I am not sure, but if you want let me know, I am happy to learn more. My email is right here and it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">example@example.com</a>.</p>
